# Carry out the exercises in your own copy of the notebook that you can find at

# Then copy and paste code asked for below in between the dashed lines.
# Do not import additional packages.
 
# Copy and paste the code for that function here:
# -----------------------------------------------
def my_mlp(w, X, sigma = np.tanh):
    # Construct between layer connection weights matrices W1, W2, and W3
    W1 = w[:4 * 6].reshape(4, 6)

    W3 = w[4 * 6 + 7 * 4:].reshape(1, 7)

    f  = sigma(W3 @ a2) # layer 2 -> output
    
    return f[0, 0, :, :]

# Task 2:
# Instructions:
# In the notebook, you wrote a function that implements a loss function for training
# the MLP implemented by my_mlp of Task 1.
# The function should accept a vector of weights, a matrix X that stores input feature
# vectors in its *columns*, and a vector y that stores the target labels (-1 or +1).

# The name of the function should be MSE_func.
 
# Copy and paste the code for that function here:
# -----------------------------------------------
def MSE_func(w, X, y): 
    f = my_mlp(w, X)
    MSE = np.sum((f-y)**2)
    return MSE
# -----------------------------------------------
 
# Task 3:
# Instructions:
# In the notebook, you wrote a function that returns the gradient vector for the least
# squares (simple) linear regression loss function.
# The function should accept a vector beta that contains the intercept (β₀) and the slope (β₁),
# a vector x that stores values of the independent variable, and a vector y that stores
# the values of the dependent variable and should return an np.array() that has the derivative values
# as its components.
# The name of the function should be dR.
 

# Copy and paste the code for that function here:
# -----------------------------------------------
def dR(beta, x, y):
    dbeta_0 = 2*np.mean(beta[0]+beta[1]*x - y) # implement the above formula for dR/dβ₀
    dbeta_1 = 2*np.mean((beta[0]+beta[1]*x - y)*x) # implement the above formula for dR/dβ₁
    return np.array([dbeta_0, dbeta_1])
